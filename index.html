        <h1>I LOVE YOU SO MUCH HONEY</h1>        

        <p>Chloe, you make my life better in every way. Before I met you, I was a stupid, shy, retarded weirdo who should have never had a shot with a girl as amazing as you. Now, after over a year and a half of dating, as we are about to get married, I look back on how you and I have grown and how you have changed me for the better. I wouldn't change anything for the whole world. You have made me happier, smarter, more sensitive and the proudest kitty daddy of all. I am still a stupid, shy, retarded weirdo, but, you have made me better in every way.</p>
